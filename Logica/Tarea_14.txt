Terminal Game - Create Hero Prototype

In this first kata in the series, you need to define a Hero prototype to be used in a terminal game. The hero should have the following attributes:
attribute 	value
name 	user argument or 'Hero'
position 	'00'
health 	100
damage 	5
experience 	0

* Código:

class Hero {
    constructor(name, position, health, damage, experience) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
        this.health = health;
        this.damage = damage;
        this.experience = experience;
    }
}

function createHero (name, position, health, damage, experience) {
    
    return new Hero(name, position, health, damage, experience)
};
createHero('Hero', '00', 100, 5, 0);
